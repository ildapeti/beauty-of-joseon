        <p class="june-date">June 01, 2022</p>
        <p class="june-par">Do you remember Shin Saimdang we introduced on Women's Day in March?<br>
            Shin Saimdang, an iconic female painter of the mid-Joseon Dynasty, left outstanding works that surmounted the discrimination against and limited activities allowed for women at that time.<br>
            Among her works, Chochungdo is a wonderful painting of grass and insects that is known to contain the wishes of the people of Joseon.<br><br>
            
            The theme of BOJ's June calendar is Chochungdo. The dianthus chinensis drawn in the illustration symbolizes youth as being like green bamboo that always stands upright while the lily, butterfly, and ginseng carry the meaning of longevity. Celosia is for wishing promotion to a high-ranking position because its shape resembles the crest of a rooster.<br>
            The dung beetle has a hard shell and was considered to be wearing armor (甲 gab), with 'gab' here symbolizing prominence.<br>
            Large watermelons and Korean melons symbolize fertility.<br><br>
            
            The Chochungdo calendar for June contains our sincere hope that all your wishes come true</p>

        <h2 class="may-head">SMALL HAPPINESS CALENDAR LETTER_MAY</h2>
        <p class="may-date">May 01, 2022</p>
        <p class="may-par">In commemoration of the Year of the Tiger in 2022, we would like to introduce the style of Korean traditional folk painting that illustrates tigers (Maenghodo).<br>
            In Korea, we believe that people born in the year of the tiger are born with the ability to lead through agility, wisdom, and dignity like that of a tiger.<br><br>
            
            In addition, since ancient times, tigers have been regarded as powerful creatures that are brave, protect humans, and discriminate between good and evil.<br>
            For this reason, on New Year's Eve, people put pictures of tigers on their doors to ward off evil spirits and wish for good luck in the coming year.<br><br>
            
            A pine tree painted with a tiger is green all year round, symbolizing longevity and constancy.<br>
            We prepared this tiger illustration for you to dispel bad energy, wish for a long life, and deliver good luck in May.<br>

        <h2 class="april-head">SMALL HAPPINESS CALENDAR LETTER_APRIL</h2>
        <p class="april-date">April 01, 2022</p>
        <p class="april-par">Team BOJ, visited a design fair in Seoul in March and saw a traditional Korean still-life painting (Chaekgado) for the first time.<br><br>

            We wanted to share the beautiful still-life paintng as well so we decided to design the April calendar with illustration of Chaekgado.<br><br>
            
            Chaekgado is a type of folk painting that mostly depicts books, stationery, incense burners, and ceramics.<br><br>
            
            During the Joseon Dynasty, books were considered very important and became a common theme in folk paintings. Chaekgado reflects the value of scholastic achievements during that era.<br><br>
            
            "Did you catch some of the little BOJ details?"<br><br>
            
            Ginseng, rice, and the black teapot used to brew Hanbang medicine with water and green plum tree are there along with the books.<br><br>
            
            We wanted to add some of the little Hanbang details and decided to add some key Hanbang ingredients along with the books.</p>
