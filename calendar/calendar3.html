        <p class="march-date">March 01, 2022</p>
        <p class="march-par">Korea is a country with four seasons, and the spring is coming with flowers in full bloom. Spring is the time when the plum blossoms bloom, the first flower to bloom before every other flower wakes up.<br><br>

            The plum blossoms bloom beautifully in the spring and produce delicious plum fruits in the cool summer, a tree we are grateful for. March 8 is also International Women's Day.<br><br>
            
            In commemoration of International Women's Day, we have planned a calendar of female characters wearing Hanbok to convey the beauty of Joseon to everyone. Hanbok is traditional Korean clothes that have been worn for a long time. 
            Women's wear consists of a jeogori(top) and a chima (skirt), and Hanbok is imbued with Korean thoughts and aesthetics.<br><br>
            
            Currently, Hanbok is worn on anniversaries such as weddings and holidays.<br>
            You can rent Hanbok at Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, the royal palaces of the Joseon Dynasty, and take beautiful photos and make good memories in spring.<br><br>
            
            This March calendar was created in the hope that you will travel to Korea in the spring and leave good memories and photos wearing Hanbok.</p>

        <h2 class="feb-head">SMALL HAPPINESS CALENDAR LETTER_FEB</h2>
        <p class="feb-date">February 01, 2022</p>
        <p class="feb-par">February in Korea is the month of Lunar New Year
            and the day of the first full moon.
            On New Year's Day, people drive 3-4 hours to see their family,
            especially their grandmother. On their way, they get a phone
            call from their grandmother asking when they will arrive.
            When they arrive, the whole family gathers and waits.
            They meet with their families to chat, play Yut Nori and fly
            kites together.<br><br>
            
            The most exciting time when you were a child was receiving
            a gift of money for the new year.<br><br>
            
            As an old Korean tradition, there is a custom of putting money
            in a bok (luck) pouch and giving it to a child. Children bow to adults,
            and adults give children a word of blessing and money.
            The bok pouch contains the meaning of wishing a year full of good fortune.
            There are many traditional items with meanings in Korea.
            I think that one small meaning like this shows sincerity to think of others.<br><br>
            
            So, I have come to like old Korean items.<br>
            This February calendar was created with the intention of sincerely blessing you.

        <p class="jan-date">January 01, 2022</p>
        <p class="jan-par">To celebrate the new year of 2022,

            I present BOJ's new project <b>Small Happiness Calendar Letter</b>.
            
            It's a bitterly cold winter. It is snowing in Korea today.<br>
            January is a very snowy month in Korea.<br>
            On such a snowy day, I traveled to Jeonju, Korea, where various hanoks
            congregate and there is a tourist destination called Hanok Village.<br>
            I recall seeing a lot of white snow piled up on an elegant hanok tile roof
            while looking around. I recall stopping walking and taking a lot of pictures
            while standing for a long time because the stillness was so beautiful.<br>
            The Calendar Project's first calendar was created with that moment in mind.<br><br>
            
            One good memory, I believe, becomes a recollections and a small
            happiness. This project was created in the hope that small amounts
            of happiness would be delivered to you in the form of a letter.<br>
            I hope the calendar for 2022 is filled with things that will satisfy
            their excitement and expectations, and I wish you the best of luck
            for the coming year.</p>
